# Freeheart

## About
Freeheart is a game framework for Unity, primarily used for game jams, but also small projects in general.

Since this is mostly a personal framework, backward-compatibility will not be a focus. Expect API-breaking changes across versions.

## Features

* A UI system designed to support transitions easily, allowing mix-mash of different approaches such as Unity Animations and tweening.
* [YarnSpinner](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unity) extensions.

## Git Dependencies
* TriInspector: https://github.com/codewriter-packages/Tri-Inspector.git

## Installation

Library is distributed as a git package. ([How to install package from git URL](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html))

## History

Freeheart is a rewrite and refactored version of the game framework seen in my game, [Sorting Battle](https://github.com/chocola-mint/Sorting-Battle).
